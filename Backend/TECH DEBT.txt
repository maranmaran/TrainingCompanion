1. validacija i kontakt baze -> tehnicki dug
2. Angular effects -> koristiti i za http dohvat, ne samo response
3. CRUD - vise genericki i nekakav uniformni kod da nema previse kerefeka
4. Exercise types load everything even tag groups (for hex colors)... flatten ? We don't need all that info i believe
5. Training fetch for calendar -> Fetch it in dictionary on server so you don't have to parse it and map to CalendarEvent
6. Virtual scroll + filtering + paging or whatever for all autocompletes that use exercise types
7. Virtual scroll for notifications https://github.com/angular/components/issues/10122
8. Dropdown box looks (basic mat select) terrible
